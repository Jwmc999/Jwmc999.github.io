title: "How to build a language translator?"
permalink: /I/Start/

So I want to build a language translator which can deal with foreign languages in a short amount of time and memory. 
The translation result should be pricise, and would handle large input about local education. 

|Application Development Bulletpoint|
|----------------|---------------|
|Purpose| Assist automatic subtitles of international online education, such as MOOC|
|Requirement|Language Translator handle both daily words and academic terminology|
|Dataset| contemporary literature, newspapers, and textbooks|
|Competency| Basic, Emergency translation between English-Local Language|


Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) based sequence to sequence learning caught my interest, so I will try to develop it for paragraph to paragraph translation of two languages, not limited to a word-to-word or sentence-to-sentence translation. 
Below is an Algorithm I am thinking:

1, Use news articles and textbooks as dataset for sentence to sentence matching system.
2. Use novels and jornals for paragraph to paragraph matching system. 
3. Word dataset origin from elementry~high school textbooks. 

4. Programming Language: C++, Java, Python (adds on)

5. Academic background: Data Structure, Machine Learning, Natural Language Process, RNN, AI (adds on)
 
We first need to distinguish langauages we will translate. I chose Korean and Japanese, pretty similar languages to each other.
