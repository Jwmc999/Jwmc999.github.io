Private Humanities keeps working on career change to Computer Scientist, and become a software developer in ther future. 
Many knows importance of Data Structure in software developing, so the private aims to solve following problems on her own. 
Her answer might be wrong, so don't just follow her code; Try it Yourself!!

## Chess Knight
![Chess](/assets/chess.png)

Chess Knight can move to 8 directions. Square chessboard width N, starting point (si, sj), and taget point (di, dj) are given.

Output minimum step counts of Knight (0 <= si, sj, di, dj < N)

Sample Input: 8 3 2 5 6
Sample Output: 2

## Chessboard problem Algorithm
1. Shortest path --> BFS
2. Create queue, set the starting cell
3. loop till queue is empty. 
- queue would be one of 8 possible movements
- check if current node equal to destination
- In BFS, its shortest path = shortest path of parent + 1
3. Count minimum steps = shortest path length
