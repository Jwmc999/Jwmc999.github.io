# Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm is defined recursively:
 - If the list is of size 1, it is sorted-we are done;
 - Otherwise:
  - Divide an unsorted list into two sub-lists,
  - Sort each sub-list recursively using merge sort, and
  - Merge the two sorted sub-lists into a single sorted list
This is the first significant divide-and-conquer algorithm we will see.
* Question: How quickly can we recombine the two sub-lists into a single sorted list?

## Merging Example
Merge sort contains three things:
- 2 sub-array already sorted,
- 1 combined, merged array that has the output of the 2 sub-array.  
1. Consider the two sorted arrays and an empty array.

|---------------------|
|3, 5, 18, 21, 24, ...|
|2, 7, 12, 16, 33, ...|
|                     |                    

2. Define three indices at the start of each array.
3. Compare 2 and 3: 2 < 3
  - Copy 2 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 3 and 7: 3 < 7
  - Copy 3 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 5 and 7: 5 < 7
  - Copy 5 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 18 and 7: 7 < 18
  - Copy 7 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 18 and 12: 12 < 18
  - Copy 12 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 18 and 16: 16 < 18
  - Copy 16 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 33 and 18: 18 < 33
  - Copy 18 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 21 and 33: 21 < 33
  - Copy 21 down
  - Increment the corresponding indices

Compare 24 and 33: 24 < 33
    - Copy 24 down
    - Increment the corresponding indices

4. Continue until we have passed beyond the limit of one of the two arrays.
== One of the sub-arrays gets ended (copied every element from 3 to 31 and there's no more elements to compare in this sub-array)

5. Copy over all remaining entries in the non-empty array (copy from 33 to 42 sequentially from the second sub-array to the result array)  

## Merging Two (Sorted) Arrays
Programming a merge is straight-forward:
- the sorted arrays, arrayA and arrayB, are of size nA and nB, respectively, and
- we have an empty array, arrayOut, of size nA+nB
- define three variables, posA = 0, posB = 0, k = 0; which index into these three arrays

## Implementation

```cpp
template <typename Type>
void Merge(Type *_arrayA, Type *_arrayB, int _nA, int _nB, Type *_arrayOut){
  int posA = 0, posB = 0, k = 0;
  while(posA < _nA && posB < _nB){
    if(_arrayA[posA]< _arrayB[posB]){
      _arrayOut[k] = _arrayA[posA];
      posA++;
    }
    else{
      _arrayOut[k] = _arrayB[posB];
      posB++;
    }
    k++;
  }
  for(; posA < _nA; posA++){
    _arrayOut[k] = _arrayA[posA];
    k++;
  }
  for(; posB< _nB; posB++){
    _arrayOut[k] = _arrayB[posB];
    k++;
  }
}
```

## Problem of Merging
We cannot merge two arrays in-place
- This algorithm always require the allocation of a new array

## Algorithm
1. Split the list into two approximately equal sub-lists
2. Recursively call merge sort on both sub lists
3. Merge the resulting sorted lists

Merge-Sort(A, p, r)
```
if p < r
   q = [(p + r)/2]
   Merge-Sort(A, p, q)
   Merge-Sort(A, q+1, r)
   Merge(A, p, q, r)
```

* Question:
We split the list into two sub-lists and sort them. How should we sort these lists?
* Answer(theoretical):
- If the side of these sub-lists is >1, use merge sort again
- If the sub-lists are of length 1, do nothing; a list of length one is sorted
* Answer(practical):
- If the sub-lists are less than some threshold length, use an algorithm like insertion sort to sort the lists
- Otherwise, use merge sort, again

## Implementation
Suppose that we already have a function

```cpp
template <typename Type>
void Merge(Type *array, int first, int midpoint ,int last)
```    
that assumes that the entries

```
array[first] through array[midpoint - 1], and
array[midpoint] through array[last - 1]
```
are sorted and merges these two sub-arrays into a single sorted array from index 'first' though index 'last-1'.
We will therefore implement a function

```cpp
template <typename Type>
void Merge_Sort(Type *array, int first, int last)
```
that will sort the entries in the positions $$first \leq i < last $$
If the number of entries is less than $$n_{T}$$, call insertion sort
Otherwise:
  1. Find the mid-point
  2. Call merge sort recursively on each of the halves, and
  3. Merge the results

```cpp
template <typename Type>
void Merge_Sort(Type *array, int first, int last){
  if(_last - _first <= NUM_THRESHOLD){
    Insertion_Sort<Type>(_array, _first, _last);
  }// $$T(1)= T(2)= ... = T(N_{T})= \Theta(1)$$
  else{
    int midpoint=(_first + _last)/2;// $$\Theta(1)$$

    Merge_Sort<Type>(_array, _first, midpoint);//$$T\left ( \frac{n-1}{2} \right )$$
    Merge_Sort<Type>(_array, midpoint, _last);//$$T\left ( \frac{n-1}{2} \right )$$
    Merge(_array, _first, midpoint, _last);// $$\Theta(n)$$ linear time
  }  
}
```

## Recursive Functions-Merge Sort
Recursion three
Given a recurrence:
$$T(n)$$ = {if $$n = 1$$, $$\Theta(1)$$
             {if $$n > 1$$, $$2T(n/2)+\Theta(n)$$
We first rewrite the recurrence as follows:
$$T(n)$$ = {if $$n = 1$$, $$c$$
             {if $$n > 1$$, $$2T(n/2) +cn$$
