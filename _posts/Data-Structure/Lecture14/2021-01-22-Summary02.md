## Critical Path
Suppose each task has a performance time associated with it
- If the tasks are performed serially, the time required to complete the task equals to the sum of the individual task times
![cripath](/assets/criticalpath.png)
- These tasks require 0.3+0.7+0.5+0.4+0.1=2.0 s to execute serially

Suppose two tasks are ready to execute
- We could perform these tasks in parallel
- Computer tasks can be executed in parallel (multi-processing)
- Different tasks can be completed by different teams in a company

Suppose task A completes
- We can now execute tasks B and D in parallel
- However, task E cannot execute until task C completes, and task C cannot execute until task B completes
  - The least time in which these five tasks can be completed is
  0.3+0.5+0.4+0.1=1.3s
  - This is called the _critical time_ of all tasks
  - The path (A, B, C, E) is said to be the _critical path_

The program described shows the critical path in red
  - We will define the critical time of each task to be the earliest time that it could be completed after the start of execution

## Finding the Critical Path
- Tasks that have no prerequisites have a critical time equal to the time it takes to complete that task
- Tasks that depend on others, the critical time will be:
  - The maximum critical time that it takes to complete a prerequisite
  - Plus the time it takes to complete this task
- In this example, the critical times are:
  - task A completes in 0.3s
  - task B must wait for A and completes after 0.8s
  - task C must wait for A and completes after 1.0s
  - task C must wait for B and completes after 1.2s
  - task E must wait for both C and D, and completes after max(1.0, 1.2)+0.1=1.3s

Thus, we require more information:
- We must know the execution time of each task
- We will have to record the critical time for each task
  - Initialize these to zero
- We will need to know the previous task with the longest critical time to determine the critical path
  - Set these to null

Suppose we have the following times for the tasks
![exmpcritical](/assets/findcriticalpath.png)

Each time we pop a vertex _v_, in addition to what we already do:
  - For _v_, add the task time onto the critical time for that vertex:
    - That is the critical time for _v_
  - For each adjacent vertex _w_:
    - If the critical time for _v_ is greater than the currently stored critical time for _w_
      - Update the critical time with the critical time for _v_
      - Set the previous pointer to the vertex _v_
1) Initialize the queue with those vertices with in-degree zero: A, F      
2) Pop task A and update its critical time 0.0+5.2=5.2
- For each neighbor of task A: B, D
  - Decrement the in-degree, push if necessary, and check if we must update the critical time:
    - B in-degree become zero, able to push to the queue.
    - Compare B and D with A's critical time. Updates to greater one.  
3) Pop task F and update its critical time 0.0+17.1=17.1
- For each neighbor of task F:
  - Decrement the in-degree, push if necessary, and check if we must update the critical time
4) Pop task B and update its critical time 5.2+6.1=11.3
- For each neighbor of task B:
  - Decrement the in-degree, push if necessary, and check if we must update the critical time
  - Both C and E are waiting on F
5) Pop task E and update its critical time 17.1+9.5=26.6
- For each neighbor of task E:
  - Decrement the in-degree, push if necessary, and check if we must update the critical time
6) Pop task C and update its critical time 26.6+4.7=31.3
- For each neighbor of task C:
  - Decrement the in-degree, push if necessary, and check if we must update the critical time
7) Pop task D and update its critical time 31.3+8.1=39.4
- task D has no neighbors and the queue is empty
  - We are done

We can also plot the completing of the tasks in time
  - We need to be able to execute two tasks in parallel for this example
![parallel](/assets/parallel.png)

Critical Path: F-E-C-D
This path consumes the longest time (Longest Path)
Critical Time: Critical Time of D
- For faster process, improve some parts of FECD.
- The task and previous task defines a forest using the parental tree data structure
