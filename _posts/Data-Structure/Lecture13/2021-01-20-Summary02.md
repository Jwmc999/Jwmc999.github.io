## Dijkstra Algorithm
Like Prim's algorithm, we initially don't know the distance to any vertex except the initial vertex
  - We require an array of distances, all initialized to infinity except for the source vertex, which is initialized to 0
  - Each time we visit a vertex, we will examine all adjacent vertices
    - We need to track visited vertices-a Boolean table of size $$\left |V\right|$$
  - Do we need to track the shortest path to each vertex?
    - That is, do we have to store (A, B, F) as the shortest path to vertex F?
  - We really only have to record that the shortest path to vertex F came from vertex B
    - We would then determine that the shortest path to vertex B came from vertex A
    - Thus, we need an array of previous vertices, all initialized to null
Iterate $$\left |V \right|$$ times:
- Find that unvisited vertex v that has a minimum distance to it
- Mark it as having been visited
- Consider every adjacent vertex w that is unvisited:
  - Is the distance to v plus the weight of the edge (v, w) less than our currently known shortest distance to w
  - If so, update the shortest distance to w and record v as the previous pointer
- Continue iterating until all vertices are visited or all remaining vertices have a distance to them of infinity
Example
Find the shortest distance from (K) to every other vertices
![krus](/assets/krus.png)
Set up table:
    - Which unvisited vertex has the minimum distance to it?
  ![dijktable](/assets/dijktable.png)
Vertex K has four neighbors: H, I, J and L
Found at least one path to each of these vertices
  ![dijkt1](/assets/dijkt1.png)
We have found the shortest path from vertex K to each of the other vertices. Using the _previous_ pointers, we can reconstruct the paths
![dijkt2](/assets/dijkt2.png)
This table defines a rooted parental tree
  - The source vertex K is at the root
  - The previous pointer is the parent of the vertex in the tree
  ![dijktree](/assets/dijktree.png)
What if at some point, all unvisited vertices have a distance $$\infty$$?
  - This means that the graph is unconnected
  - We have found the shortest paths to all vertices in the connected subgraph containing the source vertex
What if we just want to find the shortest path between vertices $$v_{j}$$ and $$v_{k}$$?
  - Apply the same algorithm, but stop when we are visiting vertex $$v_{k}$$
Does the algorithm change if we have a directed graph?
  - No
## Implementation and Analysis
The initialization requires $$\Theta(\left|V\right|)$$ memory and runtime
Iterate $$\left|V\right|-1$$ times, each time finding next closest vertex to the source
 - Iterating through the table requires is $$\Theta(\left|V\right|)$$ time
 - Each time we find a vertex, we must check all of its neighbors
 - With an adjacency matrix, the runtime is $$\Theta(\left|V\right|(\left|V\right|+\left|V\right|))=\Theta(\left|V\right|^{2})$$
 - With an adjacency list, the runtime is $$\Theta(\left|V\right|^{2}+\left|E\right|)=\Theta(\left|V\right|^{2})$$ as $$\left|E\right|=O(\left|V\right|^{2})$$
To do better:
We only need the closest vertex
How about a priority queue?
  - Assume we are using a binary heap
  - We will have to update the heap structure - this requires additional work
  The initialization still requires $$\Theta(\left|V\right|)$$ memory and runtime
    - The priority queue will also requires $$O(\left|V\right|)$$ memory
    - We must use an adjacency list, not an adjacency matrix
  We iterate $$\left|V\right|$$ times, each time finding the closest vertex to the source
    - Place the distances into a priority queue
    - The size of the priority queue is $$O(\left|V\right|)$$
    - Thus, the work required for this $$O(\left|V\right| lg\left|V\right|)$$
  Is this all the work that is necessary?
    - Each edge visited may result in a new edge being pushed to the very top of the heap
    - Thus, the work required for this is $$O(\left|E\right| lg\left|V\right|)$$
  Total runtime: $$O(\left|V\right| lg(\left|V\right|)+\left|E\right| lg(\left|V\right|))=O(\left|E\right| lg(\left|V\right|))$$
