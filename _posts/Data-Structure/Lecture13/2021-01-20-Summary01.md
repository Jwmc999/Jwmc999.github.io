## Motivation
Suwon to Busan: throws back the shortest path when input the starting and the end point.
## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem
  - It is very similar to Prim's algorithm
  - Assumption: all the edge weights are positive
## Strategy
Suppose that you are at vertex A
  - You are aware of all vertices adjacent to it
![dijk](/assets/dijk.png)
 - Is 5 the shortest distance to B via the edge (A, B)?
 - Are you guaranteed that the shortest path to C is (A, C), or that (A, D) is the shortest path to vertex D?
Accept (A, B) is the shortest path to B from A
![dijk1](/assets/dijk1.png)
 - (A, B, F) is the shortest path from A to F?
 - Are we guaranteed that any other path we are currently aware of is going to be the shortest path?
![dijk2](/assets/dijk2.png)
 - (A, B, F, E) is longer than (A, B, E)
 - (A, B, F, C) is shorter than the path (A, C)
At this point, we have the shortest distances to B and F

* In undirected, weighted graph, if the weight of all edges increased by 1, the shortest path would change.
