## Disjoint-Set Data Structure
A _disjoint-set_ data structure maintains a collection $$C={S_{1}, S_{2}, ..., S_{k}}$$ of disjoint dynamic sets.
Each set is identified by a representative which is some member of the set.
## Operations
* make-set(x) creates a new set whose only member is x
* union-set(x, y) takes the union of sets that contains x and y
* find-set(x) returns the representative of the set containing x
If **find-set(x)==find-set(y)**, then the objects x and y are in the same disjoint set
## Connected Components
Given a graph:
![concomp](/assets/concomp.png)
For each edge (x, y), perform union-set (x, y)
![union](/assets/union.png)
Note that, connected components can be computed more efficiently by using DFS
## Implementation
Alternative implementation: Let each disjoint set be represented by a tree
 - The root of the tree is the representative object
![uni1](/assets/uni1.png)
 - To take the union of two such sets, simply attach one tree to the root of the other
 - If the height of one tree is larger, add the other tree under that
 - If the heights are equal, it doesn't matter which tree goes under. In this case, the height of the result will always be +1 of the height of the trees
 - If union_set(u, v) u, v are already in the same tree, no movement needed.

 - **find-set and union-set** are now both $$O(h)$$
Normally, a node points to its children.
However, as we are only interested in the root; therefore, our interest is in storing the parent.
Assume we are creating disjoint sets the _n_ integers _0, 1, 2, ..., n-1_
Define an array
```cpp
parent -= new int [n];
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
  parent[i]=i;
}
```
If parent[i]==i, then i is a root node
  - Initially, each integer is in its own set
* Find-set function
```cpp
int Find_Set(int x){
  while(parent[x] !=x){
    x=parent[x];
  }
}
return x;
```
Complexity: $$T_{find}(n)=O(h)$$
* Union-set function
```cpp
void Union_Set(int x, int y){
  x=Find_Set(x);
  y=Find_Set(y);

  if(x != y){
    parent[y]=x;
  }
}
```
Complexity: $$T_{union}(n)=2T_{find}(n)+\Theta(1)=O(h)$$
## Optimization
To optimize both find-set and union-set, we must minimize the height of the tree
  - Therefore, point the root of the shorter tree to the root of the taller tree
  - The height of the taller will increase if and only if the trees are equal in height
## Worst-Case scenario
The worst-case disjoint set.
Attaching the tree with less height to the root of the tree with greater height, the worst case must occur when both trees are equal in height - where all the trees to be combined are always the same.

These are binomial trees, defining Pascal's triangle
  - The _binomial_ coefficients
$$\binom{n}{m}= \begin{cases} 1, & m=0 \text{ or } m=n\\ \binom{n-1}{m}+\binom{n-1}{m-1}, & 0<m<n \end{cases}=\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}$$

Suppose we have a worst-case tree of height _h_
  - We need the number of nodes and the average depth of a node
  $$\sum_{k=0}^{h}\binom{h}{k}=2^{k}=n$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^{h}k\binom{h}{k}=h2^{h-1}$$
  - Therefore, the average depth is
  $$\frac{h2^{h-1}}{2^{h}}=\frac{h}{2}=\frac{lg(n)}{2}$$
  - The height and average depth of the worst case are $$O(lg(n))$$
## Best-Case scenario
All elements point to the same entry with a resulting height of $$\Theta(1)$$:
