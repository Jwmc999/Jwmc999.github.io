# Array
- A data structure consisting of a collection of _**values**_
- Each identified by array _**index**_
  - In C/C++/Java programming languages, array index begins from 0.
  - The range of array index is [0, size -1].
```c
int score[10];//Data type Array name [Array size];
```
- In C/C++ programming language,
  - A consecutive set of memory location
  - Logical order is the same as the physical order
  - Creation of an array
```c
Type d[10];
Type *d = new Type[size];//Dynamically assign the size of the array. 1) Declare the type and d as pointers 2) Use "new" operator
// We can assign the size of the array according to the specific number
```
  - Accessing an element by array index
```c
d[5] = 2;
```
  - Release the allocated
```c
delete [] d;
```
## Creation of Arrays in C++ Programming Language
### 1-dimmensional array
```c
int arr[10];
```
```c
int* arr = new int[10];
```
### 2-dimensional array
```c
int a[3][4];
```
```c
int** a = new int* [3];
  for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
      a[i] = new int[4];
```
## Array in Memory
```c
int score[3] = {52, 17, 61};
// When we declare an array, each value gets stored sequentially in the actual RAM.
```
#### Example
```c
#include <cstdio>

int matrix[6][6];

for(int row = 0; row<6; row++)
{
  for(int col = 0; col <6; col++)
  {
    if(row<col)
      matrix[row][col] = 1;
    else if(row==col)
      matrix[row][col] = 0;
    else
      matrix[row][col] = -1;
  }
}
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pointer
- A variable storing a _**memory address**_
  - Represent the variable with 3 axes: name, value, address of memory
```c
int n = 3; //If you put *, it becomes the pointer data type.
int* pn = &n; //pointer called pn. Initialize the variable pn with the address of n.
// the value of pn becomes the address of n
// *pn is an integer
```
## & (Ampersand) Operator
- Reference operator
  - Returns the address of a variable.
```c
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
  char c = 'A';
  char* pc = &c;// pointer pc points the location of

  printf("%c %p\n", c, pc);
  printf("%p %p\n", &c, &pc);
  printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(c), sizeof(pc));//size of character, size of pointer

  return 0;
}
```
## * (Asterisk) Operator
- Deference operator
  - Returns the value at the pointer address.
  - In other words, if you put * to the pointer, you can access the value of the variable that the pointer is pointing.
```c
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
  char c = 'A';
  char* pc = &c;// a pointer pc is pointing to a variable c
  //If you put * to the pointer pc, it (*pc) prints the value of variable c.

  printf("%c %c\n", c *pc);// A A

  *pc = 'C';// If you declare 'C' to the *pc,
  //You can change the value of variable c
  //directly through the pointer (pc) that is pointing to the variable c
  printf("%c %c\n", c, *pc);// C C

  return 0;
}
```
answer:
A A
C C
#### Example: What are the results?
```c
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
  int a, b, c;
  int* pa = &a, *pb = &b, *pc = &c;

  *pa = 10, *pb = 20;
  *pc = *pa + *pb;

  printf("%d %d %d", a, b, c);

  return 0;
}
```
answer: 10 20 30
## Function Call with Pointers
- Two types of passing augments to a function:
  - Call by value: passing values. Cannot change the value.
  - Call by reference: passing addresses (pointers). Can change the value of the variable.
 ```c
 #include <cstdio>

 void swap1(int x, int y);//Call by value
 void swap2(int* px, int* py);//Call by reference

 int main()
 {
  int a = 5, b = 7;
  swap1(a, b);// swap1 cannot change the value of a and b in the main function.
  printf("%d %d\n", a, b);// 5 7
  swap2(&a, &b);// *px == a, *py == b. Change the addresses of a and b.
  // swap2 can change the value of a and b. a == *py, b == *px.
  printf("%d %d\n", a, b);// 7 5
  return 0;
 }
```
```c
void swap1(int x, int y)
{
  int temp = x;
  x = y;
  y = temp;
}
```
```c
void swap2(int* px, int* py)
{
  int temp = *px;
  *px = *py;
  *py = temp;
}
```
## Insertion and Deletion in Arrays
- Insertion and deletion can require significant number of operations in arrays.
### Linked Lists
- A linear collection of data elements
- Order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- Each element points to the next.
- Each node consists of an **item** and a **link** (hook)
### Inserting & Deleting an Element into a Linked List
- Works
### Linked List Implementation
- A node consists of an item and a next pointer
- A linked list has its length and a pointer to the head node.
```c
typedef int Data;

typedef struct _Node
{
  Data item;
  struct _Node* next;
} Node;

typedef struct
{
  Node* head;
  int len;
} LinkedList;
```
## Arrow and Box Representation
- Box: an item
- Arrow: a pointer to the next box
  - If the arrow points nothing, it is called the NULL pointer.
- The head points the fist node.
