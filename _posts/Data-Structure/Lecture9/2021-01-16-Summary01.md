## Definition
A non-empty binary tree is an min-heap if
- The key associated with the root is less than or equal to the keys associated with either of the sub-trees (if any)
- Both sub-trees (if any) are also binary min-heaps

![heapDef](/assets/heapDef.png)

- A single node is a min-heap
- All keys in either sub-tree are greater than the root key
Important
  - There is no other relationship between the elements in the two subtrees

Example

![min](/assets/min.png)

  - The left subtree has the smallest (7) and the largest (89) objects
  - No relationship between items with similar priority

## Operations
Three operations:
* Top: we can find the top object in $$\Theta(1)$$ time
* Pop: to remove the minimum object
  - remove the root node
  - promote the node of the sub-tree which has the least value
  - Recurs down the sub-tree from which we promoted the least value
* Push: inserting into a heap may be done either
  - At a leaf (move it up if it is smaller than the parent)
    - binary min-heap use the one
    : Select an arbitrary node to insert a new leaf node
    : If both the left and right subtrees of the node were greater than the node, we are guaranteed that we don't have to send the new node down.
    : This process is called _percolation_, that is, the lighter (smaller) objects move up from the bottom of the min-heap
  - At the root (insert the larger object into one of the subtrees)
    - Other heaps use the second
