## Perfect Binary Trees
A perfect binary tree of height _h_ is a binary tree where
 - All leaf nodes have the same depth _h_
 - All other nodes are full
 - Have only two children
Recursive definition:
 - A binary tree of height _h_ =0 is perfect
 - A binary tree with height _h_ > 0 is a perfect if both sub-trees are perfect binary trees of height _h_-1
 - Perfect binary trees of height _h_ = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4

 - A perfect binary tree has ideal properties but restricted in the number of nodes : $$ n = 2^h -1 $$

## Complete Binary Trees
We require binary trees which are
 - Similar to perfect binary trees, but
 - Defined for all _n_
A complete binary tree filled at each depth from left to right
 - The order is identical to that of a breadth-first traversal
 - The height of a complete binary tree with _n_ nodes is $$h = [lg n]$$
The previous heap may be represented as the following (non-unique) complete tree:

  - Push:
  If we insert into a complete tree, we only need to place the new node as a leaf node in the appropriate location and percolate up
  -> resulting tree is still a complete tree
  
  - Pop:
  Percolating up creates a hole leading to a non-complete tree
  -> Alternatively, copy the last entry in the heap to the root
  -> percolate the original node down swapping it with the smallest of its children
  -> halt when both children are larger
  -> the resulting tree is still a complete tree
  -> in the last pop, the last entry percolated down to the point where it has no children
  : Therefore, we can maintain the complete-tree shape of a heap using BFS order

We may store a complete tree using an array:
 - A complete tree is filled in breadth-first traversal order
 - The array is filled using breadth-first traversal

## Array Implementation
A breadth-first traversal yields:
If we associate an index-starting at 1-with each entry in the breadth-first traversal, we get:

Given the entry at index _k_, it follows that:
  - The parent of node is a _k/2_
  - The children are at _2k_ and _2k+1_
(Trivial) Cost: start array at position 1 instead of position 0
- If the heap-as-array has **count** entries, then the next empty node in the corresponding complete tree is at location **posn=count+1**
- We compare the item at location **posn** with the item at **posn/2**
- If they are out of order
  - Swap them, set **posn/=2** and repeat

## Runtime Analysis
* Accessing the top object is $$\Theta(1)$$
* Popping the top object is $$O(lg(n))$$
  - We copy something that is already in the lowest depth
    - it will likely be moved back to the lowest depth
* Push:
- If we are inserting an object less than the root (at the front), then the run time will be $$\Theta(lg(n))$$
- If we insert at the back (greater than any object) then the run time will be $$\Theta(1)$$
- Arbitrary insertion
  - With each percolation, it will move an object past half of the remaining entries in the tree
    - Therefore after one percolation, it will probably be past half of the entries, and therefore on average will require no more percolations

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{h}(h-k)2^k= \frac{2^{k+1}-h-2}{n}= \frac{n-h-1}{n}=\Theta(1)$$

    - Therefore, we have an _average_ run time of $$\Theta(1)$$
  - An arbitrary removal requires that all entries in the heap be checked: $$O(n)$$
  - A removal of the largest object in the heap still requires all leaf nodes to be checked - there are approximately _n/2_ leaf nodes: $$O(n)$$

## Binary Max Heaps
A binary max-heap is identical to a binary min-heap except that the parent is always larger than either of the children
- The only difference: the root node has the maximum value in case of the min heap
- Same algorithm can be applied
Example: same data as before stored as a max-heap yields
