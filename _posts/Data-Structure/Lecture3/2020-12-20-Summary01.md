# Tree
## A collection of nodes to represent a hierarchical relationship
- Information is stored in nodes
- There is a first node, or root
- Each node has variable number of successors (children)
- Each node (other than the root) has exactly one node (parent) pointing to it.
### Example
- Directory structures
# Trees
![trees](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture3/tree.png)
## All nodes will have zero or more child nodes or children
- I has three children: J, K, and L
## All nodes other than the root node, there is one parent node.
- H is the parent of I
## The degree of a node is defined as the number of its children:
- deg(I) = 3
## Nodes with the same parent are _siblings_
- J, K, and L are siblings
## Leaf and Internal Nodes
- Nodes with degree zero (zero children) are also called leaf nodes.
- All other nodes are said to be internal nodes.
## Unordered & Ordered
- These trees are equal if the order of the children is ignored: unordered tree
- They are different if order is relevant: ordered trees
## Paths
![paths](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture3/path.png)
- A path is a sequence of nodes ($$a_{0}$$, $$a_{2}$$, ... , $$a_{n}$$), where $$a_{k+1}$$ is a child of $$a_{k}$$.
  - The length of this path is _n_
  - The path (B, E, G) has length 2
## Depth
![depth](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture3/depth.png)
- For each node in a tree, there exists a unique path from the root node to that node.
- The length of this path is depth of the node.
  - E has depth 2
  - L has depth 3
## Height
![height](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture3/height.png)
- The height of a tree is defined as the maximum depth of any node within the tree
  - The height of a tree within one node is 0
    - Just the root node
  - For convenience, we define the height of the empty tree to be -1
## Ancestor and Descendant
- If a path exists from node _a_ to node _b_
  - _a_ is an ancestor of _b_
  - _b_ is a descendent of _a_
- Thus, a node is both an ancestor and a descendent of itself
  - We can add the adjective strict to exclude equality: _a_ is a strict descendent of _b_ if _a_ is a descendent of _b_ but $$a \neq b$$
## The root node is an ancestor of all nodes
### Example
![ansc](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture3/ancestors.png)

- The descendants of node B are B, C, D, E, F, and G
- The ancestors of node I are I, H, and A
## Representation
- List representation for child nodes (e.g.: linked list)
  - Store the children with a list of pointers (or node indices).
