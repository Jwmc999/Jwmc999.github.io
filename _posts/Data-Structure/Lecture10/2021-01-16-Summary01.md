## Heap Sort
- Inserting _n_ objects into a min-heap and then taking _n_ objects will result in them coming out in order
- Strategy: given an unsorted list with _n_ objects, place them into a min-heap, and take them out

## Analysis of Heap Sort
- Taking an object out of a heap with _n_ times requires $$O(lg(n))$$ time.
- Therefore, taking _n_ objects out requires $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}lg(k)=lg\left ( \prod_{k=1}^{n} k \right )=lg(n!)$$
- Heap sort requires only a constant amount of space.
- Heap sort does not require as much external memory

## $$lg(n!)$$ and $$nlg(n)$$
A plot of $$lg(n!)$$ and $$nlg(n)$$ suggests that they are asymptotically related:

## In-place Implementation
- Problem: This solution requires additional memory, that is, a min-heap of size _n_
- This requires $$\Theta(n)$$ memory and is therefore not in place
- Is it possible to perform a heap sort in place, that is, require at most $$\Theta(1)$$ memory (a few extra variables)?
- Instead of implementing a min-heap, consider a max-heap:
 - A heap where the maximum element is at the top of the heap and the next to be popped

![max](/assets/max.png)

- Consider this unsorted array: [46 52 28 17 3 63 34 81 70 95]
-  This array represents the following complete tree:
- This is neither a min-heap, max-heap, or binary search tree

Additionally, because arrays start at 0 (we started at entry 1 for binary heaps), we need different formulas for the children and parent.
* The formulas are now:
  - Children: _2k+1_ and _2k+2_
  - Parent: _(k-1)/2_

Can we convert this complete tree into a max-heap?
- Restriction: The operation must be done in-place

Let's work bottom-up: each leaf node is a max heap on its own
- Starting at the back, we note that all leaf nodes are trivial heaps.
- Also, the subtree with maximum number of the root is a max-heap
- Percolating down and/or swap
- Starting with the next higher level, percolating down and/or swap
- The final product is a max-heap

## Analysis of Heapify
Considering a perfect tree of height _h_:
- The maximum number of swaps which a second-lowest level would experience is 1, the next higher level, 2, and so on

![heapify](/assets/heapify.png)

At depth _k_, there are $$2^k$$ nodes and in the worst case, all of these nodes would have to percolated down _h-k_ levels
  - In the worst case, this would requiring a total of $$2k(h-k)$$ swaps

Writing this sum mathematically, we get:
$$\sum_{k=0}^{h}2^{k}(h-k)=(2^{h+1}-1)-(h+1)$$

Recall that for a perfect tree, $$n=2^h+1-1$$ and $$h+1=lg(n+1)$$, therefore
$$\sum_{k=0}^{h}2^{k}(h-k)=n-lg(n+1)$$

Each swap requires two comparisons (which child is greatest), so there is a maximum of $$2n$$ (or $$\Theta(n)$$) comparisons

### Example: Heap Sort
Convert unordered array with _n=10_ elements into a max-heap
[46 52 28 17 3 63 34 81 70 95]
None of the leaf nodes need to be percolated down, and the first non-leaf node is position $$n/2$$
1. Compare 3 with its child and swap them
2. Compare 17 with its two children and swap it with the maximum child (70) ...
3. Converted the unsorted array into a max-heap
[95 81 63 70 52 28 34 17 46 3]

4. Pop the maximum element of this heap: gap at the back of the array
5. Fill the last entry in the array with the largest element
6. Repeat this process: pop the maximum element, and then insert it at the end of the array (pop and append)

## Summary
- Heapification runs in $$\Theta(n)$$ (linear time)
- Popping _n_ items from a heap of size _n_, runs in $$\Theta(n lg(n))$$ time
  - We are only making one additional copy into the blank left at the end of the array
- Therefore, the total algorithm will run in $$\Theta(n lg(n))$$ time
- No worst-case scenarios
  - Dequeuing from the heap will always require the same number of operations regardless of the distribution of values in the heap
- One best case: if all the entries are identical, then the runtime is $$\Theta(n)$$
- The original order may speed up the heapification, however, this would only speed up an $$\Theta(n)$$ portion of the algorithm
