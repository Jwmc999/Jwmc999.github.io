# Graph Traversal
- Process to visit nodes in a graph.
- Traversals of graphs are also called searches.
- How to perform the traversal?
  - Breadth-first search (BFS)
  - Depth-first search (DFS)
## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Algorithm description
  - Choose any vertex, mark it as visited and push it onto queue.
  - While the queue is not empty:
    - Pop a vertex _v_ from the queue
    - For each vertex adjacent to _v_ that has not been visited:
      - Mark it visited, and
      - Push it onto the queue
 - This continues until the queue is empty
  - Note: if there are no unvisited vertices, the graph is connected.
#### Example
![BFS](/_posts/Data-Structure/Lecture4/bfs.png)

- Performing a breadth-first traversal with a queue
  - Push the first vertex onto the queue
  - Pop A and push B, C and E
  - Pop B and push D
  - Pop C and push F
  - Pop E and push G and H
  - Pop D
  - Pop F
  - Pop G and push I
  - Pop H
  - Pop I
  The queue is empty: we are done.
  (A, B, C, E, D, F, G, H, I)
## Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Algorithm description:
  - Choose any vertex, mark it as visited and push it onto stack.
  - While the stack is not empty:
    - Pop a vertex _v_ from the stack
    - For each vertex adjacent to _v_ that has not been visited:
      - Mark it visited, and
      - Push it onto the stack
- This continues until the stack is empty
  - Note: if there are no unvisited vertices, the graph is connected.
#### Example
- Performing a depth-first search with a stack
  - Push A
  - Pop A and push B, C, and E
  - Pop E and push G and H
  - Pop H and push I
  - Pop I
  - Pop G
  - Pop C and push D and F
  - Pop F
  - Pop D
  - Pop B
  The stack is empty: we are done.
  (A, E, H, I, G, C, F, D, B)
- DFS ordering is not necessarily unique.
  - e.g.: order to push neighbors to stack could be (A, B, D, C, F, E, G, I, H)
## Connected Components
- To identify connected components in a graph:
  - Perform DFS or BFS.
  - Check whether all the vertices are visited or not.
  - If not, perform DFS or BFS from one of unvisited vertices until all the vertices are marked as visited.
