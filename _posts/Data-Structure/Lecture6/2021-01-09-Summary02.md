## Control Statements
- These are statements which potentially alter the execution of instructions
  - Conditional statements
    - if, switch
  - Condition-controlled loops
    - for, while, do-while
  - Count-controlled loops
    - for i from 1 to 10 do ... end do; #Maple
  - Collection-controlled loops
    - foreach(int i in array){ ... } //C#
- Given
```cpp
if(condition)
{
  //true body
}
else
{
  //false body
}
```

- The runtime of a conditional statement is:
 - the run time of the condition (the test), plus
 - the run time of the body which is run
- In most cases, the run time of the condition is $\Theta(1)$ (constant)

- In some cases, it is easy to determine which statement must be run:

- IN others, it is less obvious
## Analysis of Statements
- In this case, we do not know
- If we had information about the distribution of the entries of the array, we may be able to determine it
 - if the list is sorted (ascending) it will always be run
 - if the list is sorted (descending) it will be run once
 - if the list is uniformly randomly distributed, then?
  - It will be discussed at the end of this topic
## Condition-controlled loops
- The initialization, condition, and increment usually are single statements running in $\Theta(1)$
```cpp
for(int i=0; i< n; i++)
{
  //... code which is $\Theta(f(n))$
}
```
Assuming there are no break or return statements in the loop, the run time is $\Omega(n)$
- If the body does not depend on the variable (in this example, i), then the run time of for() is $\Theta(n f(n))$
- If the body is O(f(n)), then the run time of the loop is O(n f(n))
