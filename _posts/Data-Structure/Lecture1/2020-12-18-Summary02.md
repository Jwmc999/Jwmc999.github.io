# Topics
## Fundamental data structures
- Array, list, stack, queue, heap, tree, and graph
- Graph traversal algorithms: DFS and BFS
## Algorithm analysis
- Asymptotic notations and analysis
- Time and space complexities
## Fundamental algorithms:
- Sorting
- Shortest path
- Minimum spanning tree
- Topological sort
- Dynamic programming
## Stack and Queue
- Stack
- Queue
## Tree and Graph
- Tree
- Graph
## Algorithm Analysis
Suppose that we have two algorithms.
As a computer scientist, how can you tell which is better?
- Insertion sort vs merge sort
- Merge sort vs quicksort
## (Asymptotic) Algorithm analysis to evaluate solutions
- Time/space complexities
- Weak ordering
## Shortest Path
- A path between two nodes in a graph such that the sum of weights of its constituent edges is minimized.
## Minimum Spanning Tree
## Topological Sort and Critical Path
## Dynamic Programming
## Interval scheduling
- A largest set of non-overlapping intervals
## Edit distance
## Matrix chain multiplication
