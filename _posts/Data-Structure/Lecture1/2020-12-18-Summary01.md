**Course Objectives**
* Discuss key data structures and algorithms essential for solving problems with computers
* (Powerful) Programming skills
  - Translate your idea into languages that computers can understand
  - Live coding session!
* Computational thinking
  - Problem formulation (abstraction)
  - Solution expression (automation)
  - Solution execution and evaluation (analysis)
* "How to think like a computer scientist"

**Summary**
* Definitions and examples of
- Data structures
- Algorithms

## Data Structures
Data Structure is a collection of
- Data values
- Relationships among data values
- Operations that can be applied to the data
## Abstraction
- Process of removing details while preserving information relevant to solving the problem
## Fundamental data structures
| Primitive | Non-Primitive |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Integer, Float, Character | Linear, Non-Linear, Files |

| Linear  | Non-Linear|
|:-------|:-------|
|Arrays, Lists | Trees, Graphs|

|Lists|
|:------|
|Stacks, Queues|

Appropriate data structure should be chosen according to the data characteristics
## Algorithm
* An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
* An instance of a problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.
  - A correct algorithm:
  - for every input instances, halts with the correct output

## Sorting Problem
* A sorting algorithm
  - Input: A sequence of _n_ numbers <_a1, a2,..., an_>
  - Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence, <_b1, b2,..., bn_>, such that _b1=<b2=<...=<bn_
  - Instance: <7, 10, 4, 5, 2>
