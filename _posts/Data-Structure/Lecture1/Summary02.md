- Array, list, stack, queue, heap, tree, and graph
- Graph traversal algorithms: DFS and BFS
## Algorithm analysis
- Asympotic notations and analysis
- Time and space complexities
## Fundamental algorithms:
- Sorting
- Shortest path
- Minimum spanning tree
- Topological sort
- Dynamic programming
# Stack and Queue
## Stack
## Queue
# Tree and Graph
## Tree
## Graph
# Algorithm Analysis
## Suppose that we have two algorithms. 
As a computer scientist, how can you tell which is better?
- Insertion sort vs merge sort
- Merge sort vs quicksort
## (Asymptotic) Algorithm analysis to evaluate solutions
- Time/space complexities
- Weak ordering
# Shortest Path
## A path between two nodes in a graph such that the sum of weights of its constituent edges is minimized. 
# Minimum Spanning Tree
# Topological Sort and Critical Path
# Dynamic Programming
## Interval scheduling
- A largest set of non-overlapping intervals
## Edit distance
## Matrix chain multiplication
