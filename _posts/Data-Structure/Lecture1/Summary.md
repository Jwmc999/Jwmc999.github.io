# **Data Structures**
## Data Structure is a collection of 
- Data values
- Relationships among data values
- Operations that can be applied to the data
## Abstraction
- Process of removing details while preserving information relvant to solving the problem
## Fundamental data structures

Primitive: "Interger, Float, Character"
Non-Primitive: "Linear, Non-Linear, Files"
Linear: "Arrays, Lists"
Non-Linear: "Trees, Graphs"
Lists: "Stacks, Queues"

- Appropriate data structure should be chosen according to the data characteristics
## Algorithm
- An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
- An instance of a problem consists of the input needed ot compute a solution to the problem.
- A correct algorithm:
* for every input instances, halts with the correct output
## Sorting Problem
- A sorting algorithm
* Input: A sequence of _n_ numbers <_a1, a2,..., an_>
* Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence,
<_b1, b2,..., bn_>, such that _b1=<b2=<...=<bn_
* Instance: <7, 10, 4, 5, 2>
