## Fibonacci Numbers
```cpp
long long F(long long n){
  if(n<=1) return 1;
  return F(n-1)+F(n-2);
}
```
Runtime is similar to the actual definition of Fibonacci numbers: $$T(n)=\begin{cases} \Theta(1) & n\leq1 \\ T(n-1)+T(n-2)+\Theta(1) & n>1\end{cases}$$
$$F(n)=\begin{cases} 1 & n\leq1 \\ F(n-1)+F(n-2)+1 & n>1 \end{cases}$$

Problem:
- To calculate F(50), it is necessary to calculate F(48) and F(49)
- To calculate F(49), necessary to calculate F(48)
- It gets worse
Possible solution:
- To avoid calculating values multiple times, store intermediate calculations in a table
- When storing intermediate results, this process is called _memoization_
- We save (_memoize_) computed answers for possible later reuse, rather than re-computing the answer multiple times
Memoized version:
```cpp
long long F(long long n, bool isFirstCall= false){
  static long long *memo;
  if(isFirstCall){
    if(memo != NULL){delete[] memo;}
    if(n !=0){
      memo = new long long [n+1];
      for(int i=0; i<n+1; i++){
        memo[i]=0;
      }
    }
  }
  if(n<=1) return 1;
  if(memo[n]==0)
  memo[n]=F(n-1)+F(n-2);
  return memo[n];
}
```
use 'static' instead of global variables.

## Top-down and Bottom-up Algorithms
This also allows for another approach:
- Our implementation is top-down
- From the very top, we break the problem into sub-problems
- All divide-and-conquer algorithms we have seen are top-down
Alternative approach is bottom-up approach
- Solve smaller problems and use these to build a solution for the problem
- Merge sort could be implemented bottom-up
  - Divide the array into groups of size _m_ and sort each group with insertion sort
  - Merge adjacent pairs into groups of size _2m_ where possible
  - Repeat this successively until the entire list is sorted
  ``cpp
  long long F(long long n){
    if(n<=1) return 1;
    long long ret=1, prev=1;
    for(long long i=2l i<=n; i++){
      ret=ret+prev;
      prev=ret-prev;
    }
    return ret;
  }
  ```
## Dynamic Programming
In solving optimization problems, the top-down approach may require repeatedly obtaining optimal solutions for the same sub-problem.
Dynamic programming is distinct from divide-and-conquer, as the divide-and-conquer approach works well if the sub-problems are essentially unique
 - Storing intermediate results would only waste memory
If sub-problems re-occur, the problem is said to have _overlapping_ sub-problems
