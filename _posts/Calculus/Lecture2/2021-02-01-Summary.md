$$P(x)=a_{0}+ a_{1}x+ ...+a_{n}x^{n}, & a_{n}\neq 0$$
$$f(x)=a^x, & a>0$$

1. Predict Future Population
P(t): population at time t
$$P_0$$: present population
r: Malthus constant
$$P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}$$

2. Radiocarbon Dating Model
m(t): remaining density of radio carbon at future t
$$m_0$$: present
k: negative decided by half-life
$$m(t)=m_{0}e^{kt}$$

e: Euler number
For $$y=a^x$$, when "slope of tangent line at (0,1)" = 1
e = a 

## Log Function
Inverse function of exponential function.
$$y=a^x, a>0, a\neq 1$$
$$x=log_{a}y$$ 

$$a^{log_{a}(y)}=y$$: $$a^{log_{a}}$$ and $$log_{a}(y)$$ are inverse relation
$$log_{a}a^{(x)}= x$$: $$log_{a}a$$ and $$a^{(x)}$$ are inverse relation
