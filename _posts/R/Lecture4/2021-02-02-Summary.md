## Basic Statistics
By data chracteristics
Qualitative Data: (Categorical Data)
Data that is not composed of numbers, or expressible by any kind of size. 

Quantitative Data: 
Data that has been quantified to numbers with specific sizes.

Discrete Data: Data in integers.
Continuous Data: Data with decimals. 

By number of variables
Univariate Data:
Data with one variable. 
Stored in vector.

Multivariate Data:
Data with more than two variables.
Stored in matrix, data frame.

## Terminology
Population: the entirety of groups that we are interested in, and would like to analyze. 
Sample: part of the population that could represent the entire group. Subset of the population.
Error: wrongness of sampling
Population parameters: standards that show the characteristics of specific population. Means, standard divisions.

## Univariate Qualitative Data Analysis
For qualitative data, counting is the first step.

1. 
table(): create Frequency Distribution Table
length(): length of vector (total number)
table()/length(): ratio of data

```r
ans=c("Y", "Y", "N", "Y", "Y")
table(ans)
table(ans)/length(ans) # returns N, Y ratio
```
2. Create Bar Graph
Store data as vector

Store frequency distribution table using table()

barplot(): create bar graph

```r
favorite.color<- c("red", "green", "yellow", "red", "green", "red", "red")
sum<- table(favorite.color)
sum # frequency distribution table
barplot(sum, main="Favorite color") # main: graph title
```

Bar Graph

```r
head(mtcars)
carb<- mtcars[,"carb"] # extract number of carburetors
table(carb) # carb is a vector. As we can COUNT the models with one carburetors, even though carb is quantitative data, we can use it for bar graph
barplot(table(carb), main="Barplot of Carburetors", xlab="#of carburetors", ylab="frequency")
# xlab: x axis label, ylab: y axis label
```

barplot() parameters

|instance|explanation|
|-------|----------|
|angle, density, col|slope, density of shading lines, colors of bars|
|legend|legend for the plot|
|names|label for each bar|
|width|bar widths|
|space|space between bars|
|beside|TURE: columns are portrayed as juxtaposed bars|
|horiz|TRUE: horizontal bar|

Multiple Graphs in one Screen

```r
par(mfrow=c(1,3)) # divide the screen virtually, divide to 1*3
barplot(table(mtcars$carb),
main="Barplot of Carburetors",
xlab="#of carburetors",
ylab="frequency",
col="blue")
```

Create Pie Graph

```r
favorite.color<- c("red", "green", "yellow", "red", "green", "red")
sum<- table(favorite.color)
pie(sum, main="Favorite color")
```

## Assignment
1. Extract education column of infert dataset. Store it to edu, and show value of edu.

2. Show value of edu without overlaps

3. Show frequency distributed table of edu values 

4. Show bar graph of edu values

```r
edu<- infert[,"education"]
edu
unique(edu)
table(edu)
barplot(table(edu), main="Bar Plot of Education")
```

## Univariate Quantitative Data Analysis
Quantitative data has various analysis methods.
First step is to calculate mean/median

Mean (or Median): Characteristics of data 
Trimmed Mean: Mean of (100-2n)%. Calculated after sorting out the values that are too high or too low. 
Median is useful for when it is not nomal distribution.

Quartile: Q1, Q2(=Median), Q3

```r
mydata = c(50, 60, 100, 75, 200)
mydata.big= c(mydata, 50000)
mean(mydata)
mean(mydata.big)
median(mydata)
median(mydata.big)
mean(mydata, trim=0.2)
mean(mydata.big, trim=0.2)
quantile(mydata)
quantile(mydata, (0:10)/10)
summary(mydata) # min, max, mean, median
fivenum(mydata)
```

Distribution
: The way the data is dispersed, or spread.

Variance and Standard deviations
: How far from the mean?

Large variance or standard deviation $$\rightarrow$$ data well away from the average.

diff(): DIfference
var(): Variance
sd(): Standard deviation

```r
diff(range(mydata)) # range(): max, min of the data. Small diff() value means data dispersed over a small area
var(mydata) # 
sd(mydata) # 
```

## Box Plot

![Box Plot](/assets/boxplot.png)

```r
head(state.x77)
st.income<- state.x77[, "Income"]
boxplot(st.income, ylab="Income value")
boxplot(Petal.Width~Species, data=iris, ylab="Petal.Width") # ~Species: Petal.Width by Species
```

## Histogram

Approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data

```r
st.income<- state.x77[,"Income"]
hist(st.income, main="Histogram for Income",
xlab="income",
ylab="frequency",
border="blue",
col="green",
las=2, # x axis range
breaks=5) # number of bars
```

## Stem-and-Leaf Plot

```r
score<- c(30, 40, 50, 100, 90)
stem(score, scale=2) # number of data by score range. scale: number of stem
```
## Assignment
Course Score
|KOR|ENG|MATH|HIST|SOC|MUSIC|BIO|EARTH|PHY|ART|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|

names(score)<-c("KOR", "ENG", "MATH", "HIST", "SOC", "MUSIC", "BIO", "EARTH", "PHY", "ART")
score
mean(score)
median(score)
sd(score)
colnames(max(score))
boxplot(score, main="Hong's score",
        col="Purple")

wt<- mtcars[,"wt"]
mean(wt)
median(wt)
mean(wt, trim=0.15)
sd(wt)
summary(wt)
cyl<- mtcars[,"cyl"]
table(cyl)
barplot(table(cyl))
gear<- mtcars[,"gear"]
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(score)
barplot(cyl)
barplot(gear)
boxplot(wt)
disp<- mtcars[,"disp"]
boxplot(disp)
```
 
## Tips
paste(): combines a number of characters to create a unified sentence
sep: separator
substr(): substring. Split the strings.
nchar(): number of character. Length of a string.
gsub(): replace

```r
paste("Good", "Mornig", "Tom", sep=" ")
paste(1:10, "is good", sep=" ") # 1 is good, 2 is good, 3 is good, etc
str<- "Good Morning"
substr(str, 1, 4) # "Good" 
substr(str, 6, nchar(str)) # "Morning"
gsub("Good", "nice", str) # "nice Morning"
str<- gsub(" ", "/", str) # store change to str
str # "Good/Morning"
```
